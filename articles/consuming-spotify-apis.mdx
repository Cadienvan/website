Finally, another article in my (poor üòì) blog. Sometimes I don't know what to say, or what to explain you. But in this case, I show you how I've integrated **Spotify** API's into my website.

As you can see in this [section](https://mateonunez.dev/spotify) I made 2 sections showing you my the **Last Songs I Played**, the **Top Artists** and my **Top Tracks**.

## üë®‚Äçüç≥Ô∏è Ingredients

- [next](https://nextjs.org/) | `v12.1.5`
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) | `v18.0`
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) | `v3.0.23` _(optional)_
- [Spotify Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) | `REQUIRED `

## üîë Authorization Code Flow

Is the image above clear? (not for me)

Now, Spotify has a lot types of _Authentication_ flows ([read more](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/)). I'll use the **Authorization Code Flow**, I'll run the flow locally because the only person who can access my API is me.

The first step is to create a new Application in [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).

> Bro are you serious? Do I have explain you how to create a new application? I'm a developer, not a philosopher.

> The only thing I can say is that you need add (into the Redirect URIs your `localhost:port` for development). I think it's enough.

When you're done, you'll have a new application, a new `Client ID` and a new `Client Secret`, required for the next step.

Personally, I prefer to store the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in a `.env` file, but you can use any other way.

> .env.local.example

```script
# Spotify
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=
```
