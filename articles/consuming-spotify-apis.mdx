Finally, another article in my (poor 😓) blog. Sometimes I don't know what to say, or what to explain you. But in this case, I show you how I've integrated **Spotify** API's into my website.

As you can see in this [section](https://mateonunez.dev/spotify) I made 2 sections showing you my the **Last Songs I Played**, the **Top Artists** and my **Top Tracks**.

## 👨‍🍳️ Ingredients

- [next](https://nextjs.org/) | `v12.1.5`
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) | `v18.0`
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) | `v3.0.23` _(optional)_
- [Spotify Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) | `REQUIRED `

I'll divide the article in 4 phases:

- [Authentication with OAuth2](#authentication-with-oauth2)
- [Currently Listening](#currently-listening)
- [Recently Played](#recently-played)
- [Top Artists/Tracks](#top-artists-tracks)

## 🔑 Authentication with OAuth2

## 🎧 Currently Listening

## 🔁 Recently Played

## 🔝 Top Artists/Tracks
